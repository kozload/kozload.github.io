                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>My name is <b>Adam</b>.<br>I have many interests and some still ask me: ‘what is it you actually want?’<br>But I have my <b>own clock</b>.</p>
                <p>Indeed, I had doubts along the way.<br>There were moments I felt lost.<br>...while patience was never my strongest suit.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless I learnt to <b>trust myself</b> with the plan on how to achieve my goals.</p>
                <p>I am currently opening the new chapter in my life.<br>The attributes I have gathered so far will catalyse in this final adventure.<br>The journey to human mind.</p>
                <p>I decided to become a <b>neuropsychiatrist</b>.<br>I will acquire <b>PhD in Public Health</b>.<br>I am going to set up the company for <b>Health Design & Strategy</b>.</p> 
                <p>I hope this path will bring me <b>fulfillment, peace and stability</b>.<br>Being adventurous is not very lucrative and the constant changes give heartbreaks.</p>
                <p>As I wish to enrich this website further.<br>I hope it will finally include some thoughtful <b>posts</b><br>and more about the <b>projects</b> that I wish to <b>collaborate on</b>.</p>
