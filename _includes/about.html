                <p>My name is Adam.</p>
                <p>I have many interests and some still ask me: ‘what is it you actually want?’</p>
                <p>But I have my own clock.</p>
                <p>Indeed, I had some doubts along the way. There were moments I felt lost... and patience was never my strongest suit.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless I learnt to trust myself with the plan on how to achieve my goals.</p>
                <p>I am currently opening the new chapter in my life. The attributes I have gathered so far will catalyse in this final adventure.</p>
                <p>The journey to human mind.</p>
                <p>I decided to become a neuropsychiatrist. I would acquire PhD in public health and I am going to set up the company for Health Design & Strategy.</p> 
                <p>I hope this path will bring me peace and stability. Being adventurous is not very lucrative and the constant changes give heartbreaks.</p>
