                <p>Hello y’all!</p>
                <p>My name is Adam. I have many interests, where some still ask me: ‘what is it you actually want?’</p>
                <p>I have my own clock. Indeed, I had some doubts along the way, there were moments I felt lost. And patience was never my strongest suit. But I learnt to trust myself with the plan on how to achieve my goals.</p>
                <p>I am currently opening the new chapter in my life. The attributes I have collected so far will catalyse in this final adventure. The journey to human mind. I decided to become a neuropsychiatrist. I would like to acquire PhD in public health and I plan to set up the company for Health Design & Strategy. I hope this path will bring me peace and stability. Being adventurous is not very lucrative and the constant changes give heartbreaks.</p>
